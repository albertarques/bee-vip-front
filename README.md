We have developed this marketplace framed in the category of services for Colombian society, helping them to upload businesses or products on our website.

***

This project is part of the F5's final project. We have two weeks to create a marketplace with the following guidelines:
## 1. COLOMBIA SHOP MARKETPLACE
- What kind of content are you going to have in it?
- Who is your target audience?
- How are you going to improve people's lives?

## 2. MAKE A GOOD DESIGN
## 3. SHAPE THE CONTENT OF YOUR CARDS
- Which attributes does your card have?
- Which values could those attributes take?
- Which attributes are mandatory and which ones aren't?

## 4. ADD BASIC FUNCTIONALITY
- Homepage with card lists
- Show view of a specific card

## 5. ADD EXTRA FUNCTIONALITIES
- Contact form to be in touch with the company
- Search bar
- About us
- Contact the client
